# Methodology Specification

## Introduction

This document describes the shared methodology among all teams in the CS490
Software Production Studio course in Spring 2020.

TODO: How to teams make modifications?

## Background

We recognize and seek [the seven properties of Crystal
Clear](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/7-properties-of-highly-successful-projects-from-crystal-clear.php),
which are summarized below:
1. Frequent Delivery
2. Reflective Improvement
3. Osmotic Communication
4. Personal Safety
5. Focus
6. Easy Access to Expert Users
7. Technical Environment with Automated Tests, Configuration Management, and
   Frequent Integration

We uphold the value of safety through practices inspired by
[Anzeneering](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/anzeneering/).

## Team Rules

1. The team owns the project. There are many kinds of work to be done, and any
   work can be done by any team member. You are authorized to contribute in any
   way to the project. Some people will tend to work on particular aspects of
   the game, but that is by choice, not by constraint.

    - We foster [T-shaped
      skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills), such that all team
      members share core competencies, and individual team members provide depth
      in particular areas.

1. Maintain effort only on tasks that are part of the current release.
    - Corollary: Solve the problems you have, not the problems you might have later.

1. We take an _iterative_ and _incremental_ to building software.
    - _Iterative_ means that we work in iterations, with each iteration of
      production being bookended by a planning meeting at the beginning and
      review and retrospective meetings at the end.
    - _Incremental_ means that each iteration produces an increment that is an
      executable release or potentially shippable product. That is, each
      iteration produces a playable game.

1. Each team designates one team member as _producer_. 

    - The producer role may change at any time by majority vote of the team,
       although it is preferable to keep the role for one iteration.
    - The producer's primary role is _to remove impediments to the team's progress_.
    - The producer's secondary role is to communicate progress to the project
      mentor in his capacity as executive producer.

1. We start each "production day" (that is, any day not set aside for some other purpose) with a 9AM daily standup meeting, during which each member reports on the following to their team:
    - What did you contribute since last time?
    - What will you do today?
    - Are there any impediments in your way?

    Before 10AM, the producer or team designate should communicate the team's status
    with the mentor, including any pertinent impediments.

1. TODO: Late policy and missing meeting notification policy.

1. Each team establishes a _mission statement_ that provides a lens for analyzing
   project ideas. It allows you to say "no" to good ideas.

1. Team access to shared resources (such as rooms and devices) is negotiated via
   a producers' meeting.

1. TODO: Stop Work Authority

1. Keep a respectful volume level in the studio in order to respect the focus of
   your teammates.

1. Keep the discussion in the studio about the project. If you would like to
   talk about something unrelated (including taking a phone call), take it to
   the hallway or another location so as not to distract those who are focused
   on the project.

1. If a team member has a conflict with another team member, he or she should
   talk to that individual about it privately first, face-to-face. If a
   resolution is not met, the issue should be brought to the project mentor.

1. When faced with a design conflict (including software architecture,
   implementation details, user interface design, and game design) where two or
   more team members disagree, monitor the amount of time spent on the
   discussion. If a resolution is not found within five minutes, take one of the
   following options:
    - Invite the project mentor for a consultation.
    - Get a volunteer for each side. Schedule a follow-up meeting, with all
      relevant stakeholders, at which time each volunteer will be expected to
      demonstrate prototypes to defend their positions. After this, the
      stakeholders vote on which direction to pursue.

1. Prefer working in pairs whenever possible, particularly on technical and
   integration tasks. Rotate pairs at least once a week to ensure that knowledge
   is distributed across the team.
