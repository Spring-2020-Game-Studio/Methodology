# Distributed Retrospectives

## Introduction

This document provides guidance for how to run distributed retrospectives.
This guide can be reviewed by the whole team but is most important
for the facilitator.
It assumes fluency with the [conventional retrospectives guide](Retrospectives.md).

## Goal

The ultimate goal of the retrospective is to improve the team's operation.
We do this by changing the methodology based on intentional reflection,
both individually and collectively.

## Setup

Set up a [Trello](trello.com) board for the retrospective and ensure that
the whole team has access to it. The board should have three columns:
"What worked well," "What can be improved," "Appreciations," and 
"Action Items".

Make sure everyone can connect to the same videoconferencing solution
such as [Zoom](zoom.us). 

Prepare an ordering of team members that will be used for an early
step in the retrospective.

## Agenda

1. *Prime Directive:* Read aloud the Retrospective Prime Directive, which is taken from Norm
   Kerth's _Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review_.

    >Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that
   everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their
   skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

1. *Check-in*: Let everyone know the order in which they will be invited to speak.
   In that order, each person briefly shares how they think the sprint went.
   This is best done with video enabled and using gallery view, so that you
   can see the faces of your teams.
   
   Note that this is not time for consensus-building: it is fine to quietly
   disagree. You may ask clarifying questions. A good way to approach this 
   is to try to restate what you heard in your own words, so that you can tell
   if you're on the same page.

1. *Individual Reflections*: Set a timer for 8 minutes. During this time,
   team members mute their audio and write their responses to the first
   three columns on Trello. Don't copy anything to the shared board yet:
   just type them up individually. 

   The third column is new to us if you're coming from [our conventional
   approach](Retrospectives.md). The idea here is to name something
   specific that someone did that deserves praise. 

   Remember that the fourth column is only used later in the meeting. 
   Do not add anything to it yet.

1. *Gather Responses*: Once the timer goes off, team members start copying
   their responses to cards on Trello. 

1. *Read Appreciations*: Go through the appreciations column and let the
    person who shared each item read it aloud. 

1. *Group Responses*: Walk the team through the process of removing
    duplicates in the first two columns.
    This also provides an opportunity for team members
    to clarify what has been written on the cards. 

1. *Vote for discussion topics*: Team members vote on which items
    to discuss in more detail. Invite team members to add themselves
    to cards in order to show their votes. There is no minimum or 
    maximum number of votes.

1. *Discuss*: Choose the top few (2&ndash;3) items based on votes and
    open the floor for discussion. 
    When there is an action item, ask for a champion. If there is consensus
    and a champion, then document both on the fourth column of Trello.

1. *Close*: Conclude the meeting with a quick meta-retrospective. Ask
    the team about the retrospective itself: what was good, what was bad,
    what would they change. Be sure to write these down for inclusion
    in the retrospective report. Thank the participants.
