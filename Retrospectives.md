# Retrospective Guide 

This document provides instruction to teams on how to run Sprint Retrospectives.
The guide should be reviewed by the whole team and especially studied by the
student facilitator.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of the retrospective is to improve the team's operation.
We do this by changing the methodology based on intentional reflection,
both individually and collectively.

## Setup

Write four headings on the board, in this order:
- What went well (that we might forget if we don't record)?
- What did we learn?
- What should we do differently?
- What still puzzles us?

Make sure each team member has a marker and easy access to large-format sticky
notes. It's a good idea to have some tape on hand as well, since sometimes
the sticky notes lose their stickiness.

## Retrospective Meeting Agenda

1. Read aloud the Retrospective Prime Directive, which is taken from Norm
   Kerth's _Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review.

    >Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that
   everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their
   skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

1. Set a timer for 8 minutes. During this time, each team member quietly and
   individually records their responses to the four retrospective questions.
   They can answer one question many times and others not at all: there are no
   restrictions. You might remind the team to write largely and clearly, because
   these are designed to be shared. That is, we use large sticky notes to allow
   for _large_ text, not _more_ text.

1. Once the timer goes off, the team puts their sticky notes onto the board
   under the corresponding columns. As notes are put up, the team organically
   forms the notes into clusters. Usually, all the notes are put up first, and
   then the team starts to see patterns.

1. Obtain a volunteer from the team to record potential action items. This
   person starts a visible log of potential action items by adding a
   corresponding column to the board. The role of the recorder is important:
   as the team is going through the clusters, people will voice ideas for things
   that the team could do to improve its operation. 
   It is the recorder's job to jot these down as potential action items.
   They should be numbered for ease of reference.

1. Set a timer for _M_ minutes to walk the board. As facilitator you go from the
   left column to the right column, pointing out the card or cluster that is next for
   discussion. Prompt the team to consider whether there are any potential
   action items that relate to the item. Note that potential action items must
   be measurable: "improve communication" is not measurable; "everyone checks Slack
   once per day" is measurable.

   This is a divergent exercise, and you want to avoid getting into debates or
   arguments at this point. If someone poses a potential action item, write it
   down and move on: no one is committing to anything yet. Try to guide the
   discussion fruitfully toward potential action items.

   Keep an eye on the time. This is a timeboxed meeting. Usually, you can go
   more quickly through the first two columns than the second two because the
   first two lead to fewer action items: they often point to things that are
   already working as opposed to places where change is beneficial. There can of
   course be potential action items arising from the first two columns, often to
   make explicit some activities that were emergent.

1. Set a timer for _N_ minutes. Take each potential action item in turn, asking
   if there is a _champion_ for that item. That is, will someone be responsible
   for doing it. If not, then move on: it's not worth discussing. If there is a
   champion, then have a quick discussion about whether the team wants to
   support that action collectively or not. Usually this will be
   straightforward, but if discussion goes too long, you can resolve the issue
   by simple vote. It may help to remind people that the methodology can change
   again after the next iteration, so anything that is undertaken by the team is
   essentially provisional.

## After the meeting

The facilitator writes a Retrospective Report that summarizes the results 
of the meeting. This report contains:
- A high-level view of major themes that were discussed by the team.
- The list of action items that the team approved, along with their champions.
- The team's updated methodology, annotating changes with the date of revision.

Circulate this report to your team and make sure the updated methodology is
readily available to them.
